Sound-and-Visuals Synthesizer

I have used a flute sound sample to make my Synthesizer.
CONTROLS:
By the movement of the mouse you can control the pan by moving the cursor left to right and the amplitude of 
the sound by moving the cursor up to raise the volume and down to lower the volume.
By pressing any key from the keyboard you can pause and play the instrument.
